### Sample Application

The sample application is written in Kotlin / Spring / Axon

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
[Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework)
[Axon](https://www.axoniq.io/products/axon-framework)

You need to have Docker installed.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Here are the simple steps to start the application in a development environment.

install IntelliJ IDEA
Install the most recent Java SDK (File -> Project -> SDK - mine is JDK 23.0.1)
In the terminal type 'mvn clean install', this will do a full maven install of all the dependencies
Ensure you have docker running (if you don't already have it installed on your machine, you need it for testcontainers to work. on Windows just install the docker desktop app).
Build the app
